### About the different bonding options in Linux ###

Populat bonding options and drivers are:

* Linux bonding kernel driver
* Teaming driver where only the essential stuff is in kernel, the rest is userspace
* OVS (where I guess the same is the case, but I don't know) and well the 4th one would be OVS DPDK
